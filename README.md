GPU based image resize by DirectX 11

# Overview
This is a simple console application that resizes a given image loaded into a texture, inspired by the steps explained in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/issues/93).

Majority of the code is based on [Windows-classic-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/DXGIDesktopDuplication), and it does not depend on the legacy DirectX SDK.
